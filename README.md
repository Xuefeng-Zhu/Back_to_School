## Motivation
Selecting a school which will admit you and is ranked high enough to attract sharp minds, which would allow you to challenge yourself, is one of the biggest problems while going for graduate school. I having had this experience lately, know the importance and pain of coming up with a list of schools according to our profile and chances of admission.

Our objective is to visualize the data for student profile (test scores, undergrad GPA, undergrad school) and graduate universities from which he/she got admit/reject from, and then try to find insights. This may be some correlation between university ranking and test score, or undergrad GPA and admit/reject and so on.

## How to run the code
The code in **data folder** is normal python code process data, so to run it, just type `python +filename`

The code in **demo folder** is for web application. To run it in local machine, by running `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

## Data
We already have some data from community web forums where students post their profile data and university application results. Itâ€™ll, however, be great if we can somehow get our hands on UIUC admission graduate admission data.
